# Custom_WindowsRegistryCommands
This repository contains a collection of .reg files for Windows. Each file is designed to add or modify registry entries that enable custom context menu commands, shortcuts, or other useful tweaks.

📂 Organized by category for easy navigation
⚙️ Simple double-click installation
📝 Each .reg file is documented with its purpose and effect
🛠️ Safe to remove: just delete the corresponding registry entries if no longer needed (Windows + R then regedit and search Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory)

⚠️ Disclaimer: Modifying the Windows Registry can affect system behavior. 
Always review the contents of a .reg file before applying it and create a backup of your registry.
